A GitHub Action that wraps [diff-cover](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff_cover) to report test coverage and code quality **only on changed lines**. Native GitHub integration with PR comments, inline annotations, step summaries, and badge generation.

**Zero vendor lock-in** -- everything runs locally in the GitHub Actions runner. No external services, no accounts, no data leaving your CI.

---

## Why This Action?

| | diff-cover-action | Codecov | Coveralls | coverage-diff |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Free & self-hosted** | Yes | Freemium | Freemium | Yes |
| **No external account** | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Coverage + quality in one** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **13+ lint tools** (ruff, eslint, mypy...) | Yes | No | No | No |
| **PR comments** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Inline annotations** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Step summaries** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Badge generation** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **JaCoCo / lcov / XML** | Yes | Yes | Yes | JSON only |
| **Shallow clone handling** | Auto | Manual | Manual | N/A |
| **Fork PR safe** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| **Data stays in your CI** | Yes | No | No | Yes |

**In short**: This is the only action that does **both** diff coverage and diff quality analysis in a single step, with full GitHub integration, across any language and linter -- with zero vendor dependencies.

---

## Features

- **Diff coverage** -- find lines in your PR that aren't covered by tests
- **Diff quality** -- find lint/style violations only in changed code (flake8, pylint, ruff, mypy, eslint, and more)
- **PR comments** -- auto-posted, idempotent (updates on re-run instead of spamming)
- **Inline annotations** -- uncovered lines appear directly in the PR diff view
- **Step summaries** -- coverage summary in the Actions run UI
- **Structured outputs** -- coverage %, violation count, threshold status for downstream steps
- **Badge generation** -- shields.io endpoint JSON for README badges
- **Shallow clone handling** -- automatically fetches enough history for diff-cover
- **Full CLI parity** -- every diff-cover/diff-quality flag is exposed as an input

### Supported Languages & Tools

### Inline Annotations (appear directly on the PR diff)

```
warning: src/bar.py#5-8 — Lines 5-8 are not covered by tests
warning: src/bar.py#15 — Line 15 is not covered by tests
warning: src/bar.py#22 — Line 22 is not covered by tests
warning: src/foo.py#13 — Line 13 is not covered by tests
```

### Step Summary (in Actions run UI)

The same coverage table also appears in the **Actions > Job Summary** tab so you can see results without opening the PR.

### Using Outputs

```yaml
      - name: Diff Coverage
        id: coverage
        uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          coverage-files: coverage.xml

      - name: Check result
        if: steps.coverage.outputs.threshold-met == 'false'
        run: echo "Coverage is ${{ steps.coverage.outputs.total-percent }}%"
```

## Permissions

The action needs these permissions for full functionality:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # Read repository content
  pull-requests: write  # Post PR comments
  checks: write         # Create check annotations (optional, for >10 annotations)
```

### Fork PRs

When a PR comes from a fork, `GITHUB_TOKEN` has read-only permissions. The action detects this and:
- Skips PR comment posting (with a `::notice` message)
- Annotations via workflow commands still work

To enable comments on fork PRs, use `pull_request_target`:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
```

## Shallow Clones

The action automatically handles shallow clones (the default for `actions/checkout`). It progressively fetches history until the merge-base is available. For fastest operation on large repos, set:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Full history, fastest for diff-cover
```

## Badge

Enable badge generation and use with shields.io:

```yaml
      - name: Diff Coverage
        uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          coverage-files: coverage.xml
          create-badge: 'true'

      - name: Upload badge
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: coverage-badge
          path: diff-cover-badge.json
```

Then use with a [shields.io endpoint badge](https://shields.io/badges/endpoint-badge).

## Advanced Examples

### Multiple Coverage Files

```yaml
      - uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          coverage-files: 'unit-coverage.xml integration-coverage.xml'
```

### Glob Patterns

```yaml
      - uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          coverage-files: '**/coverage*.xml'
```

### Exclude Patterns

```yaml
      - uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          coverage-files: coverage.xml
          exclude: |
            tests/*
            setup.py
            **/migrations/*
```

### JaCoCo (Java)

```yaml
      - uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          coverage-files: target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml
          src-roots: 'src/main/java'
```

### TOML Configuration

```yaml
      - uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          coverage-files: coverage.xml
          config-file: pyproject.toml
```

Where `pyproject.toml` contains:

```toml
[tool.diff_cover]
compare_branch = "origin/develop"
fail_under = 80
exclude = ["tests/*", "setup.py"]
```

### Monorepo Matrix (titled comments per app)

When several coverage jobs run in a matrix, give each comment its own heading and a unique `comment-identifier` so they don't overwrite each other:

```yaml
jobs:
  coverage:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        app: [online-store, cms, partners-app]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pnpm test:unit:${{ matrix.app }}
      - uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          title: ${{ matrix.app }}
          coverage-files: apps/${{ matrix.app }}/coverage/lcov.info
          comment-identifier: diff-cover-${{ matrix.app }}
          fail-under: '80'
```

Each PR gets one comment per app, headed with the app name.

### Conditional Failure

Report coverage without failing the step:

```yaml
      - name: Coverage Report
        id: coverage
        uses: Affanmir/diff-cover-action@v2
        with:
          coverage-files: coverage.xml
          fail-under: '80'
          fail-on-threshold: 'false'  # Don't fail, just report

      - name: Warn if low
        if: steps.coverage.outputs.threshold-met == 'false'
        run: echo "::warning::Coverage is below 80%"
```

## How It Works

1. **Git setup** -- detects shallow clones and progressively fetches history
2. **CLI execution** -- builds and runs `diff-cover` or `diff-quality` with your options
3. **Report parsing** -- parses the JSON output into structured data
4. **PR comment** -- renders a markdown comment and creates/updates it on the PR
5. **Annotations** -- emits `::warning` workflow commands for uncovered lines
6. **Outputs** -- writes `GITHUB_OUTPUT` values and `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`
